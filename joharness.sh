# Two layers live side by side under .agents/ — one dotted directory any
# tool can detect, and every path below is relative to it:
#   .agents/harness/      agent working protocol (loop, handover, style).
#                         Always on.
#   .agents/env/<name>/   one sandbox environment. Selected here, not
#                         hardcoded.
#
# Subcommands:
#   session-start   what the SessionStart hook runs (.claude/settings.json)
#   env             print the selected layer and what else is available
#   env <name>      select a layer (writes joharness.conf)
#   setup           provision the selected layer now
#   ci              run what .github/workflows/ci.yml runs, here
#   verify          provision, then run the layer's smoke test
#   review          print this branch's review step: depth for its tier, and
#                   whether its findings are recorded. Gates ci when enabled
#   feedback        score the review loop from merged history: coverage,
#                   recurrence, and the files that keep drawing findings
#   feedback <path> what earlier merged edges found in that file
#   graph           print the work graph as fenced mermaid (paste into any

#   JOHARNESS_ENV_SETUP=lazy   'lazy' (provision on demand) or 'eager'
#                              (provision at session start)
#   JOHARNESS_ENV_MD=lazy      'lazy' (inject a read-before-touching pointer
#                              to the layer's AGENTS.md) or 'eager' (inject
#                              the file whole)
#   JOHARNESS_REVIEW=off       'off' (default) or 'on'. 'on' makes `ci` fail
#                              when a workstream reaches the edge (pull
#                              request open, or status review/done) with no
#                              review recorded, and session-start say so
#
# Default is env 'none', setup 'lazy', md 'lazy', review 'off': a session that
# never asks for an environment never pays for one — not in provisioning, not
# in context — and a repo that has not opted into the review gate sees nothing

# Review step
#
# The harness has ordered a review at every edge into main since the loop was
# written (.agents/harness/AGENTS.md step 5, depth by tier in
# .agents/docs/agent-selection.md). Nothing checked that one happened. The record
# is the workstream file's `## Review` section, and only a human reading hook
# output ever noticed it empty — "a branch visibly churning with an empty
# Review section is the human's cue" (.agents/docs/handover/README.md,
# Reviewing) is the whole of today's enforcement, and it needs a human looking.
#
# Off by default, and silent while off: a repo that has not opted in sees no
# output and no gate, so `ci` here means exactly what it meant before. On, the
# check rides in `ci` — the one gate a session cannot skip, same argument the
# churn ceiling and the graph lint already rest on: the session that skipped
# its own review is the one that cannot see it skipped.
#
# What it checks is the RECORD, never the finding count. Counts carry no
# signal in either direction (.agents/docs/agent-selection.md, review churn:
# "Finding counts no signal, false both ways"), so a gate on N>0 findings buys
# invented findings and nothing else. A clean pass records one line saying it
# was clean; an empty section is not a clean pass, it is no pass.

# Feedback
#
# The review step (above) makes a branch record what its review found. The
# record then dies: the finish ritual deletes the workstream file, by design —
# a file left on `main` reads as current (.agents/docs/handover/README.md,
# Graduation). So every finding this repo ever recorded is in merge history and
# nowhere a session looks, and the next branch re-finds it.
#
# Measured on this repo's own history at the time this was written: 41 findings
# across 8 merged edges, and 9 of 24 file-level fixes (38%) landed on a file an
# earlier merged branch had already recorded a finding against. `AGENTS.md`
# under the harness drew findings on 5 of those 8 edges. A file that keeps
# drawing findings is a rule nobody has written yet.
#
# So this is two things, and the second is why the first exists:
#   feedback          the scorecard — does the loop run, does its output
#                     survive, does the same file keep coming back
#   feedback <path>   what earlier merged branches found in that file
#
# Nothing is stored. Every number is counted from git at read time, so it
# cannot rot and cannot be written wrong (the doctrine the churn measure and
# the graph lint already run on). What it cannot count, it says: finding
# volume is NOT a quality signal here — the review-churn rule already
# establishes counts are false in both directions — so the number to watch is
# recurrence, and the direction to want is down.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Every edge into the base branch: "<merge-sha> <branch-tip-sha>". Any merge
# with two parents, no subject parsing — GitHub's "Merge pull request" wording
# is one host's, and a consumer merging by hand makes the same edge.
#
# --first-parent is load bearing: without it the walk also descends into the
# branches themselves, and a branch that merged main in mid-flight (the
# protocol tells long-running ones to) contributes its own merge as a second
# edge carrying the same workstream file. Measured while writing this: 51
