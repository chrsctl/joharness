# joharness.sh dispatch — one selftest topic, sourced by ../selftest.sh in
# the order that file lists.
#
# Not runnable alone and not meant to be: the runner defines the assertion
# helpers, the counters and the shared fixtures, and sourcing is inlining.
#
# The orchestrator's one read (.agents/docs/orchestrated.md). What it must
# say: the human's numbers and where they come from; every manager in
# flight with its push age, and the STALL mark past the window; the slots
# left under the cap; the spawn order the queue hook already ranked, with
# a wave-2 item told to wait and a plan overlapping work in flight HELD;
# and one verdict line the orchestrator branches on. Builds its OWN
# scratch repo, as drain does, because every line is a property of the
# whole queue.
