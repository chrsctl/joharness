# queue-context.sh — one selftest topic, sourced by ../selftest.sh in the
# order that file lists.
#
# Not runnable alone and not meant to be: the runner defines the
# assertion helpers, the counters and the shared fixtures, and sourcing
# is inlining — a topic that builds state a later topic reads behaves
# exactly as it did when they shared one file.
#
# Reads $work, the shared scratch repo the runner builds before any topic
# is sourced (../selftest.sh, `work=`).
#
# SC2154 is off for that reason and only that reason: every name it would
# flag here is assigned in the runner or in an earlier topic, while this
# file is linted on its own. The cost is real — a typo in a variable name
# goes unflagged here — and is accepted per file, not repo-wide.
#
# The wording matters: a comment line STARTING with the linter's own name
# is read as a directive, and an earlier draft of this paragraph began one
# that way. Thirteen files failed to parse.
